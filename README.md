# ✨ AI Sound-to-Sound Virtual Assistant

Welcome to DATV Assistant! 👋 This is a virtual assistant built in Python that uses the Google Gemini API to communicate entirely through voice. It listens to your commands, processes them, and responds with a natural-sounding, concise voice. 🤖

# 🚀 Key Features

Voice Interaction: The assistant listens to your voice through the microphone and responds with a synthesized voice. 🗣️

Concise Responses: Answers are designed to be extremely brief, limited to 1-2 sentences or a maximum of 20 words, so you get information quickly. 💨

Basic Functions: The assistant can tell you the current time. ⏰

Easy Exit: You can shut down the assistant at any time with simple voice commands like "quit", "exit", or "stop". 👋

# ⚙️ Prerequisites
